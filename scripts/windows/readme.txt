Code Signing Certificate for testing
------------------------------------

How to create a new code signing certificate/key pair (only written down here for the reference)

1) Make sure you have the tools makecert and pvk2pfx. These tools can be found int the Windows
   Driver Kit (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.17134.0\x64\)

2) To make the keys and the certificate run:
   MakeCert.exe -r -pe -ss my -a sha256 -n "CN=ZetesTestCert" -sv zeteseidtest.pvk zeteseidtest.cer
   Leave the pvk password blank

3) To combine the keys and certificate in a single file run:
   pvk2pfx.exe /pvk zeteseidtest.pvk /spc zeteseidtest.cer /pfx zeteseidtest.pfx

4) double click the zeteseidtest.pfx file to install the certificate and its keys into the user's "my" store
   
Install certificate as trusted root on test machine to trust the signatures

certutil -addstore root zeteseidtest.cer
